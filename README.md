# designer

Just a simple learning project to contextualize the use of design patterns into somewhat real-life scenarios. This will
include the whole catalog of [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) plus my very own
selection. All of these will be implemented in Python for its ease of use.

Feel free to get inspired and try the exercise out by yourself.
